bio: |
  I've moved between the public and private sectors throughout my career, designing user experiences for non-profits, Fortune 500 companies, and local start-ups. My expertise is in improving complex, large-scale systems and software. I joined the Fellows for the opportunity to collaborate with City staff to create more intuitive, accessible experiences that help to serve and inform the public.
