bio: |
  I was working as a data analyst for a few years when I started to realize that even more than number crunching, I loved the feeling of creating tools to help people feel confident making their own discoveries. I started teaching myself design and coding by working on projects with Open Austin, Austin's Code for America brigade, and eventually decided to get formal training in design. I joined Fellows to bridge my experience in data and design and apply the harmony of these disciplines to solving civic problems.
