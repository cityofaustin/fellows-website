bio: |
  I made the leap to Elgin, Texas to work as a Program Specialist and later a Marketing and Development Associate at Down Home Ranch, a working farm and ranch for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. There I met my husband and found a home in Texas. Feeling the need to be closer to Austin, I left DHR for a Fulfillment Analyst position with Dell, Inc until I landed a position with Austin Resource Recovery as an Administrative Specialist. Six months into my role with ARR, my manager presented me with the opportunity to join the Fellows program as the Operations Manager.
