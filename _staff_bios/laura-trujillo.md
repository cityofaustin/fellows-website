bio: |
  I got my start writing business proposals for a graphic design firm in Washington, DC but came back to Texas after one too many blizzards. I received my MA in Rhetoric and Composition from Texas State University and pursued a freelance career&mdash;driving initial content strategy sessions, writing, and editing a variety of projects. I joined the DTI Fellows program because I wanted to help Austin become more accessible to her residents. When I'm not writing, I'm riding bikes, snuggling my chihuahuas or reading all the fiction I can get my hands on.
