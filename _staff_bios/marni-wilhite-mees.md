bio: |
  I wanted to give back to my city in a bigger way. Working for the government was never something I considered as a career option until SXSW 2016 when President Obama spoke about how it is our responsibility to give back in whatever capacity we can....suddenly the light bulb went off in my head. I love working in the tech industry, and now I get to combine my career with my passion to promote equity in our community.
