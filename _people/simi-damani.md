bio: |
  After a 10 year vision quest through the start-up landscape of Austin, I came across a band of research, content and design experts dedicated to delivering modern and empathic solutions to residents. FINAAALLLY!!! The Innovation office marries my "professional" software experience with my desire to give back to the community that I've been a resident of for 25 years. And just check out the folks I get to work with, y'all. They're pretty rad.
